<h2>💜 How to Use the Program?</h2>

- How to get Path?
1. Open windows "Run" Dialog BOX (WIN + R)
2. Enter following text:

```sh
%userprofile%
```
3. Now, proceed to the 'Saved Games' folder (note that 'saved games' may vary depending on your system's language)

Alternatively, you can accomplish this without manually searching for folders by using the command (not recommended):

```sh
%userprofile%\Saved Games\Metro Exodus
```
<h2>✨ What if ...?</h2>
➜ I don't have a folder with my ID
- Try to reference the parent folder
➜ The application doesn't want to start for me
- Turn off your antivirus program
- Run the application with administrator privileges
